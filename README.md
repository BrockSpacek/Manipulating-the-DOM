Manipulating the DOM
Description: Created a website that allows user to click 10 different buttons and change things based on them.

Peer Review: Andrie Amor

Comments: Very clean and very creative. I like the way this page is put together. The shake button doesn't seem to shake the text on item 10. Other than that everything works well and is nice.
