Manipulating the DOM
Description: Created a website that allows user to click 10 different buttons and change things based on them.

Peer Review: Andrie Amor

Comments: Very clean and very creative. I like the way this page is put together. The shake button works its just that you have to zoom out to see it happen when clicking the button. Other than that everything works well and is nice.
